# Welcome to Nym Localnet: Empowering PEApps with Local Nym Infrastructure

## Overview

Nym Localnet is your go-to solution for setting up a local Nym infrastructure, providing all the essential components needed for Privacy-Enhanced Application (PEApp) development. Say goodbye to testing on public networksâ€”Nym Localnet empowers developers to create and test their PEApps on a secure local environment.

## Key Features
